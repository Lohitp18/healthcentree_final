            Ultrasound scanning is a safe, painless test that uses sound waves to create real-time images of the bodyâ€™s internal organs and tissues. This non-invasive procedure is a crucial diagnostic tool for a wide range of medical conditions.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-slate-700">
              During an ultrasound, a small device called a transducer is placed on the skin. It sends high-frequency sound waves into the body, which bounce off internal structures and return to the transducer. A computer then uses these returning echoes to form a live image on a monitor. This allows doctors to observe organs and tissues in real time without the use of radiation.

              <li>**Safety:** It's a radiation-free procedure, making it safe for all patients, including pregnant women.</li>
              <li>**Painless & Non-Invasive:** There are no needles or injections involved, and the procedure is typically very comfortable.</li>
              <li>**Real-Time Imaging:** Allows doctors to see movement of internal organs, blood flow, and a baby's heartbeat during pregnancy.</li>
              <li>**Versatility:** Used to examine many parts of the body, including the abdomen, heart, blood vessels, and muscles.</li>
