        <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Dialysis is a life-saving treatment that removes waste products, excess fluids, and toxins from the blood when the kidneys are unable to function properly. It helps maintain balance in the body, improves overall health, and supports a better quality of life for patients with kidney failure.
